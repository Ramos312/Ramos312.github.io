	<h1> The Difficulties Of Being A Veteran. </h1> 
			
	
 <p> It is estimated that the number of veterans who commit suicide can be as high as 20 soldiers a day. It is too high of a number and we must do everything possible to lower it.
Many times we forget to give them the tools for a better adaptation to civilian life. Some of the problems veterans face can be substance abuse, PTSD, anxiety and many more. Alcohol can be an 
escape valve after the immense stress to which they are exposed. Stress caused by being in a combat zone, deploy where they are far away
 from your family for extended amounts of time.</p>

		<h2 > What can we do to help? </h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure veterans have access to quality healthcare, including mental health services.</li>
			<li>Advocate for better job opportunities and training programs specifically tailored towards veterans. </li>
			<li>Create mentorship programs that pair veterans with civilian professionals in their chosen field of work or study.</li>
			<li>Support legislation that helps protect the rights of veterans, such as ensuring they receive proper pensions and benefits 
	from their service time.</li>
			<li>Increase awareness about the unique challenges faced by returning service members and how to best support them through
        difficult transitions back into civilian life (i.e., PTSD).</li>
